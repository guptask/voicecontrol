# Voice Control
Laptop functionality control using Google's speech recognition toolkit

### Debian/Ubunutu installation

    sudo apt-get install python (requires 2.7.2+ - so default ubuntu/debian repo version should work)
    sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
    sudo pip install SpeechRecognition

    Other packages are subject to usage:
        xdotool
        nautilus
        gnome-do
        gnome-screensaver-command

### Windows installation

    Install python, pyaudio and SpeechRecognition package. You have to figure out the rest.
